 Parfis

Parfis is an acronym for PARticles and FIeld Simulator. Parfis is written in 
C++ with Python bindings. The algorithm is based upon the particle-in-cell 
(PIC) method used for interacting many-particle systems. In the PIC method
individual particles (or fluid elements) in a Lagrangian frame are tracked 
in a continuous phase space, whereas moments of the distribution such as 
densities and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) 
mesh points.
