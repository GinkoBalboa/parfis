# Parfis

Particles and field simulator. Simulator written in C++ with Python interface.
Simulator is based on an altered particle-in-cell (PIC) method. In the PIC method
method individual particles (or fluid elements) in a Lagrangian frame are tracked
in a continuous phase space, whereas moments of the distribution such as densities
and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) mesh points.


## Build from source

Project is build with CMake. We have the project compiling under Windos and Linux
distributions
