# Parfis
Particles and field simulator. Simulator written in C++ with Python interface.
Simulator is based on an altered particle-in-cell (PIC) method. In the PIC method method, individual particles (or fluid elements) in a Lagrangian frame are tracked in continuous phase space, whereas moments of the distribution such as densities and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) mesh points.
